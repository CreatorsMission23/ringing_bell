# the ringing of the bell
we know you’re gonna feel it. it’s better than fire and sulfur isn’t it?

## who
only the Creator can make the earth shake like this. 

## why
that’s as close to being put over His knee as the u.s. government and the c.i.a. want to get. 

all unaffiliated people with this tragedy should know He’s not upset with you, but it should serve as a reminder He hears all prayers and makes life His number one priority. that’s why we were deployed this time: to make life way longer and healthier than currently imaginable through one-time, low-cost or free, single-dose formulations designed by the Creator, that we are to distribute globally. 

## what 
we’ve been referring to this as the ringing of the bell. not because we get wings. but it’s what scientists say about the earth after a great quake. 

this is because the Creator is quite upset. see the why.
